# Log Classification with Hybrid Classification Framework 🚀✨📝

This project implements a **hybrid log classification system**, combining three complementary approaches to handle varying levels of complexity in log patterns. The classification methods ensure flexibility and effectiveness in processing predictable, complex, and poorly-labeled data patterns. 🤖📊🔍

## Classification Approaches 🎯📌📚

### 1. **Regular Expression (Regex)** 🎭📏✅

- Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
- Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.

### 2. **Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression** 🧠📈📝

- Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
- Utilizes embeddings generated by **Sentence Transformers** and applies **Logistic Regression** as the classification layer.

### 3. **LLM (Large Language Models)** 🌐💡🤖

- Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available.
- Provides a fallback or complementary approach to the other methods.

## Architecture 🏗️🗂️📂

### Folder Structure 🏢📁📌

```
📂 log_classification/
│── 📂 training/        # Training code for models (Sentence Transformer, Logistic Regression, Regex)
│── 📂 models/         # Saved models (Sentence Transformer embeddings & Logistic Regression model)
│── 📂 resources/      # Resource files (test CSV files, output files, images, etc.)
│── server.py         # FastAPI server code

```

## Setup Instructions ⚙️🔧📋

### 1. Install Dependencies 🏗️📦⚡

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Then, install the required Python libraries:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the FastAPI Server 🚀🖥️🔗

Start the FastAPI server using:

```sh
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

Once the server is running, access the API at:

- **Main endpoint:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) 🌍🔗
- **Interactive API Docs (Swagger UI):** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) 📜🖥️
- **Alternative API Docs (ReDoc):** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) 📖📝

## Usage 📂📊📝

1. Upload a **CSV file** containing logs to the FastAPI endpoint for classification.
2. Ensure the file has the following columns:
   - `source`
   - `log_message`
3. The API will return a **CSV file** with an additional column **`target_label`**, representing the classified label for each log entry. 📊✅📋
